# This file contains the definition for a class that holds a cache of all the
# objects that are required at each iteration of the optimisation procedure.
# This is done for the purpose of organising exactly what arrays have been
# allocated in memory.

# To get this going, I need to list ALL of the arrays I need to complete a
# single iteration of the optimisation loop. These arrays are re-used over each
# iteration.
